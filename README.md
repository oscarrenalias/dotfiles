Oscar's dotfiles
================
This is my own take on the idea of [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.com).

It does not use any of the dotfiles frameworks described there so this probably only works for me and my different workstation, but feel free to take a look.

Installation
============
For a local installation, clone the repository and run the *bootstrap.sh" script.

For a remote installation, run the following command:

    curl https://raw.github.com/oscarrenalias/dotfiles/master/install/install.sh|sh
    
This will automatically download the remote installation script, clone the repository and run the boostrap script.

Please note that *git* is needed in both cases.
